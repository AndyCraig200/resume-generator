The simple task of buying software, services, or tools at work has become hopelessly complicated at even the most innovative companies in the world. Today, enterprises spend $120T+ per year globally (>30 times larger than annual consumer e-commerce spend) and rely on vendors more than ever before to run their businesses.

Our cofounders started Zip in 2020 to address this seemingly intractable problem with a purpose-built procurement platform that provides a simple, consumer-grade user experience. Within the last 4 years, Zip has created a new category and developed the leading solution in this $50B+ TAM space. Today, the worldâ€™s leading companies like OpenAI, Snowflake, Anthropic, Coinbase, and Prudential rely on Zip to manage billions of dollars in spend.

We have a world-class team coming from category-defining companies like Airbnb, Meta, Stripe, Salesforce, Apple, and Google. With a $2.2 billion valuation and $370 million in funding from Y Combinator, Tiger Global, BOND, DST Global, and CRV, weâ€™re focused on developing cutting-edge technology, expanding into new global markets, andâ€”above allâ€“driving incredible value for our customers. Join us!

Your Role
Weâ€™re growing quickly and need your help: we launched in early 2020 and are growing by 40+% every month.

As a Senior/Staff Software Engineer you will be responsible for building Zipâ€™s core products and architecture.
